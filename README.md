I am currently a consultant and trainer in cybersecurity for CyberUniversity where I teach about various fields related to cybersecurity.

## Objective

As a trainer, I've got to learn about various subjects within the realm of cybersecurity, and I grew particularly interested in understanding attacks. Thus, my goal would be to work either as someone emulating them, or analysing them.
